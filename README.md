# CHORUS Perceptual Storyteller
A tool for mapping stories from an emotional and perceptual perspective
This is a tool for mapping stories from an emotional and perceptual perspective. Instead of focusing on plot points, it helps you structure a narrative based on environmental cues, internal feelings, and shifts in a character's perception.

The goal is to visually choreograph the "inner" storyâ€”the one of feeling and experienceâ€”that drives the external plot.

âœ¨ The Core Method

CHORUS is built on three layers of visual grammar:

    Chunks (The "What"): Self-contained moments of perception, feeling, or thought.
    Shapes (The "How"): Defines a chunk's function (Internal, External, Shift, etc.).
    Colors (The "Feeling"): Represents the emotional tone (Conflict, Calm, etc.).
    Relationships (The "Why"): Lines show how chunks influence each other (*triggers*, *reveals*, etc.).
    AI Assistant (The "Spark"): Use the âœ¨ icon in any chunk to deepen details, explore internal states, or suggest thematic echoes. Requires a Google AI API key.
